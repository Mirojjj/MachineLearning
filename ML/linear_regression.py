# r (Correlation Coefficient): This is the Pearson correlation coefficient of the linear regression. The correlation coefficient, r, measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between the two variables x and y. Its value ranges from -1 to 1:

# r = 1 indicates a perfect positive linear relationship.( x increases y increaes)
# r = -1 indicates a perfect negative linear relationship. ( x increases y decreases)
# r = 0 indicates no linear relationship.
# p (P-value): This is the two-sided p-value for a hypothesis test whose null hypothesis is that the slope of the regression line is zero. The p-value helps you determine the statistical significance of your results:

# A small p-value (typically â‰¤ 0.05) indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis, suggesting that the slope is not zero and there is a significant linear relationship between x and y.
# A large p-value (> 0.05) suggests weak evidence against the null hypothesis, indicating that the slope might be zero, and there may not be a significant linear relationship between x and y
